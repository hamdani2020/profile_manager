# User Profile Manager

This script checks and manages a user's profile information when they log into the terminal. It verifies if the user is in the correct working directory (matching their username) and manages a `.profile.txt` file, which stores basic profile information like name, phone, and email. If the profile information is missing or out of date, the script prompts the user to update it.

## Features

- **Current Directory Check**: Ensures the user is in a directory named after their username.
- **Profile Information Management**:
  - Checks for a hidden `profile.txt` file.
  - Displays profile information if available, and asks the user to confirm if it is up to date.
  - If the file is missing or information is outdated, the script prompts the user to enter or update their profile information.
- **Directory and File Creation**: 
  - If the current directory does not match the username, it creates a new directory in the user's home directory with their username.
  - Creates a new `.profile.txt` file to store profile information if it does not exist.
